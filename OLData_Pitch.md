What is it?
========================================================

**An App that puts orbital launch vehicle data at your finger tips.**

With the Orbital Launch Data App, a user is able to:
 - Easily access/filter orbital launcher data about operational, in-development and retired vehicles
 - Visually explore trends in orbital launcher payload capability - both LEO and GTO
 
Whether you're a researcher or just a curious space nerd, data on orbital launch vehicles can often be difficult to find. 

This app provides a **free and easy-to-use database**. In one place, a user can now explore orbital launch vehicle data such as: manufacturer, country of origin, payload capacity, number of launches, first flight.


Filter Data
========================================================

Using the left-hand-side panel (see below), a user can restrict the orbital launchers shown based on **LEO/GTO capability, operational status and number of launches.**
